# Data Visualization and API Integration  

The process of linking several software programs using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate smooth data sharing and interchange is known as API Integration. System-to-system or platform-to-platform communication is made possible by APIs, which serve as middlemen.  


Key Aspects of API Integration:-
REST & SOAP APIs: REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs exchange data in formats like JSON or XML using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. A protocol called SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) makes sure that communication is organized and safe.  
Authentication & Security:
To guarantee safe access, authentication techniques such as OAuth, API keys, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are frequently used in API integration.  
Key Aspects of Data Visualization:- 
Visual Types: - Charts & Graphs: Bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and line charts for trend and comparison analysis.  
 Maps & Heatmaps: Visualizations based on geography or density.  
  Interactive tools that combine several graphic components are called dashboards.  
Libraries & Tools: - JavaScript libraries for web-based visualizations include D3.js, Chart.js, and Plotly.js.  
  For data science applications, use the following Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Bokeh.  
BI Tools:For enterprise-level analytics, use Tableau, Power BI, and Google Data Studio.  
 Real-Time Data Visualization: Visualizing real-time data (such as financial markets and Internet of Things sensors) using WebSockets, APIs, and streaming technologies.
