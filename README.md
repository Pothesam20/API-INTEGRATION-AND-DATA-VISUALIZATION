 Data Visualization and API Integration  

The process of linking several software programs using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate smooth data sharing and interchange is known as API Integration. System-to-system or platform-to-platform communication is made possible by APIs, which serve as middlemen.  


Key Aspects of API Integration:-
REST & SOAP APIs: REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs exchange data in formats like JSON or XML using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. A protocol called SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) makes sure that communication is organized and safe.  
Authentication & Security:
To guarantee safe access, authentication techniques such as OAuth, API keys, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are frequently used in API integration.
